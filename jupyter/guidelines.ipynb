    "    - If the series is too long, relying on a simple implementation of `pandas` or `numpy` to manage your data might not be feasible due to memory limitations.\n",
    "    - Some packages like `xarray` are compatible with `dask`, a package used for distributed and lazy computation, providing useful APIs to interact with your data.\n",
    "    - However, for very long series such as in the case of CW, even though you can build lazy arrays but those packages requires you to construct the time-axis before creating the object.\n",
    "    - In the case of GPS times, for example, you need `float64` indices to avoid losing information, effectively limiting the size of the object you want to work with.\n",
    "    - `polars` is `pandas`-like package that implements some useful features, such as lazy computation. The problem is that the package is very young, also is not GPU-compatible yet (not easly, anyway).\n",
